#This is a script to follow Twitter accounts automatically
#1. Create a file called "follows.txt" in the same folder of this script
#2. Each line of that file must contain the screen name of the account you want to follow

#Warning! - You can get your account blocked if you follow too many people all at once
#           I recommend to use these script each 8-10 minutes and follow 5 accounts per call

#PSD: You can automate this script by using "cron" in Linux, "Windows Task Scheduler" in Windows or AppleScript in Mac
